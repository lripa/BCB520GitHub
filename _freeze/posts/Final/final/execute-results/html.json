This course provides accessible, condensed training and \"knowledge networking\" for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty and professionals to ensure competency in basic biology, current trends and developments, and practical knowledge for U.S. and global vector-borne diseases of plants, animals and humans. We seek to train the next generation of scientists and help working professionals to more effectively address current and emerging threats with holistic approaches and a strong network of collaborators and mentors.\"\n\nHere's a link to the IHHE website:\n\n<https://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/ihhe/education/vector-borne-diseases>\n\nSo, as part of the organizing advisory committee, we have been considering how to examine the evolution and popularity of the course applicants over the last six years. **A suitable visualization would be a world map displaying the home countries of the applicants, year by year**.\n\n# **Data**\n\nWrite a summary of the data sources you will use. Include a `Data Dictionary` table that fully describes each individual data file used. You may use your own research data or publicly available data from any source you like (with attribution). There aren’t any minimum or maximum data set size requirements, other than you need something big enough to be interesting and not so big that we don’t have a supercomputer capable of creating your visualization.\n\n**NEW REQUIREMENT: Your assignment must feature one of the two new data types we have considered since the midterm: NETWORK DATA or SPATIAL DATA.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'rnaturalearth' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'sf' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLinking to GEOS 3.11.0, GDAL 3.5.3, PROJ 9.1.0; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl) \nparticipants <- readxl::read_excel(\"BVBD Applicants Merged.xlsx\")\nworld <- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\nworld$centroid_lon <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(world$geometry))[, 1]\nworld$centroid_lat <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(world$geometry))[, 2]\nparticipants_with_centroids <- participants %>%\n  left_join(world %>% select(name, centroid_lon, centroid_lat), by = c(\"Country\" = \"name\"))\nggplot(data = participants_with_centroids) +\n  borders(\"world\", colour = \"gray\", fill = \"lightgray\") + # Draw the base map\n  geom_point(aes(x = centroid_lon, y = centroid_lat, color = as.factor(Year), shape = as.factor(Year)), size = 2) + # Plot points with varying colors and shapes per Year\n  scale_color_viridis_d(name = \"Year\") + # Use a nice color scale for colors\n  scale_shape_manual(name = \"Year\", values = c(16, 17, 18, 19, 15, 8)) + # Manually set shapes, adjust values as needed based on the number of years\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Participants by Country and Year\", x = \"Longitude\", y = \"Latitude\", color = \"Year\", shape = \"Year\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 261 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](final_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
