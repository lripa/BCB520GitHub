# Hi, welcome to Lucas Ripa's GitHub.

I'm an agricultural engineer from Chile who came to the US to pursue an MSc in entomology and made the decision to continue pursuing a PhD in entomology. I guess I like insects... My goal is to improve agricultural practices, finding ways to reduce inputs and maximize yields (lowering pests populations).
