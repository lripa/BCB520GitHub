## Preamble

The main goal of this midterm is to assess the University of Idaho's performance regarding awarded grants and how we compare to other geographically close universities. The funding agencies are; The National Science Foundation, The National Institutes of Health, The Department of Energy, and The US Department of Agriculture.

We were provided with several data sets from 4 different funding agencies. A quick overview for each funding agency is provided below:

1.- Department of Energy (DOE)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
try({
  DOE <- read_xlsx("DOEawards.xlsx")
  
  DOE_UI <- DOE %>% 
    dplyr::filter(Institution == 'Regents of the University of Idaho')
  
  DOE_UIFiltered <- DOE_UI %>%
    select(Title, Institution, PI, Status, `Program Office`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Amount Awarded to Date`)
  
  # Display the table
  knitr::kable(head(DOE_UIFiltered))
}, silent = TRUE)

```

2.- The National Institutes of Health (NIH)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Attempt to read the Excel file and process it
try({
  # Read the Excel file into a data frame
  NIH <- read_xlsx("NIH.xlsx")
  
  # Filter and select specific columns from the NSF data frame
  NIH_Filtered <- NIH %>%
    select(contact_pi_name, award_amount, budget_start)
  
  # Display the table using knitr::kable
  knitr::kable(head(NIH_Filtered))
}, silent = TRUE)

```

3.- Department of Agriculture (NIFA)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
USDA_UI  <- read.csv("USDAtoUI.csv")
knitr::kable(head(USDA_UI))
```

4.- The National Science Foundation (NSF)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Attempt to read the Excel file and process it
try({
  # Read the Excel file into a data frame
  NSF <- read_xlsx("NSFtoUI.xlsx")
  
  # Filter and select specific columns from the NSF data frame
  NSF_Filtered <- NSF %>%
    select(pdPIName, startDate, expDate, estimatedTotalAmt)
  
  # Display the table using knitr::kable
  knitr::kable(head(NSF_Filtered))
}, silent = TRUE)


```

## Data Dictionary table 

In general all the data sets shares the same variables with different names. The most commonly used ones are summarized in the table below:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
datatable  <- read_xlsx("DataDictionary.xlsx")
knitr::kable(head(datatable))
```

## QUESTION 1:

Provide a visualization that shows our active awards from each sponsor. I need to see their start date and end date, the amount of the award, and the name of the Principal Investigator. I’m really interested in seeing how far into the future our current portfolio will exist. Are there a bunch of awards about to expire? Are there a bunch that just got funded and will be active for a while? Does this vary across sponsors?

```{r}

library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

funding_data <- read_xlsx("UIawards.xlsx")

# Count the unique PIs per agency
pi_count_per_agency <- funding_data %>%
  group_by(Agency) %>%
  summarise(PI_Count = n_distinct(PI))

# Filter for the specific agencies if the dataset contains more agencies
pi_count_per_agency <- pi_count_per_agency %>%
  filter(Agency %in% c("NSF", "NIH", "USDA", "DOE"))

# Create the bar chart
ggplot(pi_count_per_agency, aes(x = Agency, y = PI_Count, fill = Agency)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of PIs Per Agency",
       x = "Agency",
       y = "Number of PIs") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")



```

In general NSF seems to be the funding agency with the most PIs in UofI history. USDA and DOE seems to fund always the same PIs.

# Convert 'start' and 'end' columns to Date format
df$start <- as.Date(df$start, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
df$end <- as.Date(df$end, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Create a timeline that spans 10 years back and 10 years forward from today
timeline_start <- Sys.Date() - years(10)

```

According to the plotted data, NSF and NIH appear to have secured grants into the furthest future, (2028-2029).

## QUESTION 2:

What is the proportional representation of new awards to the UI from these various sources over the past 5 to 10 years? Are there any trends that are encouraging or discouraging?

## QUESTION 3:

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

BU <- read_xlsx("NIH.xlsx")

# Use 'BU' instead of 'df' for operations
selected_universities <- BU %>%
  filter(organization.org_name %in% c("BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY", "UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO")) %>%
  group_by(organization.org_name) %>%
  summarise(total_award_amount = sum(award_amount, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create the bar chart
ggplot(selected_universities, aes(x = organization.org_name, y = total_award_amount, fill = organization.org_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Award Amount by University NIH",
       x = "University",
       y = "Total Award Amount NIH") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY" = "blue", "UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO" = "gold"))

```

How is UI performing with these sponsors when compared to the following peer institutions?

Boise State University Idaho State University Montana State University University of Montana Washington State University Note that “performing” can mean a variety of different things. You must choose your metrics of performance and justify them.

## Conclusions

Summary Summarize your results. What new questions have emerged as a result of your visualizations? What interesting next steps have emerged?
